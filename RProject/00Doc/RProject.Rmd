Data Viz Yelp R Project
===
**This project analyzes a subset of the yelp data from the [Yelp Academic Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) which has been stored in an Oracle database.**

###This is how my RStudio is configured:
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

###These are the packages I load from .Rprofile:
```{r}
# To get this to work in your environment, change the following directory/folder path to the path to your project files.
setwd("~/Dropbox/Classes/DataViz/DataVizYelp/RProject/")
system("cat .Rprofile", intern = TRUE)
```
